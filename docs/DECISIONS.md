# Decisions

One ruling per entry, append-only.\
A ruling is never edited; a later one supersedes it and says so.

Rulings that shape this component together with others are held in zorg's `docs/DECISIONS.md`, and cited here as "zorg's `Dn`".

---

## D1 - The component stands in its own repository

**Ruled by:** the director, 2026-10-10 (zorg's `D35` and `D37`).\
**Affects:** this repository.

**Ruling.**\
This component, operation-command, is sovereign and stands in its own repository, private until its first working code, on the terms of zorg's `D16`.\
Its contract of record is `CONTRACT.md` (zorg's `D17`), and its vision becomes enduring only when the director ratifies it.

**Why.**\
It holds no application's content, so it is a shared component even while one application builds it (zorg's `D35`), and both zorg and drawv2 need it (zorg's `D37`).

---

## D2 - The vision is ratified

**Ruled by:** the director, 2026-10-11 (zorg's `D44`).\
**Affects:** `VISION.md`.

**Ruling.**\
The vision is ratified at `bc84def`, after three rounds of cold reading by three model families, and its status line says so.\
From here it changes only by a recorded decision, absorbed into it.

## D3 - The first release, 0.1.0, carrying the five shared fixes

**Ruled by:** the director, 2026-11-10 (draw's `H31-5`, on zorg's agreement: draw's request, `upstream/drawv2-shared-component-fixes-request.md`, and zorg's reply, `upstream/drawv2-shared-component-fixes-reply.md`, whose answers bind).\
**Affects:** `package.json` and its lockfile, `.nvmrc`, `.github/workflows/gate.yml` and `release.yml`, `tools/consumer-test.mjs`, `CONTRACT.md`'s frontmatter and Reference, and `README.md`; nothing in `src/`, and nothing the component does.

**Ruling.**\
The five fixes every consumer of the components zorg maintains needs, made by draw's builders on zorg's agreement, none changing what the component does:
1. A release in the pinned-file form, gated by CI: `gate.yml` runs `npm test` and `npm run docs:check` on every push and pull request on Node 22 and 24, then the consumer test on Node 22 -- the package packed, installed into an empty project with `--omit=dev`, no AGP package installed, and every export imported by name; `release.yml`, on a tag `v<version>` that the repository's `release tags` ruleset protects, runs the gate, packs the package once, attaches the `.tgz` and its `.sha512` to a draft GitHub release, downloads both back and compares them, and only then publishes, immutable releases being enabled for the repository before its first tag; the first release is `0.1.0`.
2. A Node 22 floor: `engines` `>=22`, and `.nvmrc` `22`.
3. Dependencies between components as release files: `@apnex/operation-call` and `@apnex/shape-check` from `file:` links to their `0.1.0` release files, each pinned in the lockfile by its integrity.
4. AGP declared as what it is: unchanged: AGP's packages were already development dependencies, `file:` links to an AGP checkout.
5. The contract's frontmatter brought to mission-kit's: `id: C9`, `status: active`, and the sentences that said the id was unminted and the repository private until its first working code restated.

**Choices made at build.**
- `private: true` stays: it stops publishing to the npm registry, and `npm pack` packs the package with it.
- The style rules `npm run docs:check` holds are vendored in `tools/`, so CI fetches no mission-kit checkout.
- CI runs Node 24 at `24.12.0`, the version zorg certified, not the latest 24: the first run, on `24.22.2`, failed one test, `a URL type with a pattern` in `test/contract/declared-command-dispatch.test.js`, since from Node 24.22 the runtime's URL parser (ada `4.0.0`) takes `ws://xn--abc.example:1/` and `ws://xn--a-ecp.example:1/`, which the test expects it to refuse, while `24.12.0` (ada `3.3.0`) and Node 22 refuse both; a setting is read by the runtime's own parser, so which texts are URLs is the runtime's, and the test's expectation is zorg's to revisit, as it guarded the readback rule beside it on Node 24.
- In CI this repository is checked out into a folder of its own and `apnex/agp` beside it, both inside the workspace, since `actions/checkout` places a repository only there; AGP is checked out with its history and then at `b179b4f` by that short id, so no full commit id is written but the actions' own pins, and built with `npm --prefix ../agp ci && npm --prefix ../agp run build` before `npm ci`, so the `file:` links to `../agp/packages` resolve (zorg's answer 3).
- Its contract claims no browser runtime, so the consumer test imports the package in Node alone, loading nothing in Chrome.

**Why.**\
Draw takes components as public GitHub release files pinned by hash and runs Node 22 in production (draw's `H26-2`); a `file:` link builds only beside a checkout, and an AGP declared for install would make every consumer install it though every import of it is a type.
